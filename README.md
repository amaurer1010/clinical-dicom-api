# Clinical DICOM Analysis API

A FastAPI service that extracts structured metadata from DICOM medical imaging files and generates plain-language clinical summaries using the Anthropic Claude API.

Built as a portfolio project to demonstrate healthcare domain knowledge combined with modern backend development — directly relevant to clinical workflow integration work.

---

## Background

During my time as a research engineer at the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute / AKH Vienna, I worked extensively with DICOM data from cardiac 4D CT studies — extracting imaging data from PACS, segmenting patient-specific heart models, and collaborating with clinicians on device positioning and timing within the cardiac cycle. The metadata fields selected, including cardiac gating parameters like trigger delay and heart rate, are chosen based on what experiences I had in the workflow with medical data.

---

## What It Does

- `POST /dicom/analyze` — Accepts a DICOM file and returns structured JSON metadata including modality, study details, imaging parameters, and cardiac gating tags where present
- `POST /dicom/summarize` — Returns the same metadata plus a plain-language clinical summary generated by Claude, suitable for a non-technical workflow dashboard

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** — REST API framework
- **pydicom** — DICOM file parsing
- **Anthropic Claude API** — LLM-powered clinical summarization
- **Docker** — Containerized deployment
- **Python 3.11**

---

## Setup

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:amaurer1010/clinical-dicom-api.git
cd clinical-dicom-api
```

**2. Add your Anthropic API key**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your key from console.anthropic.com
```

**3a. Run with Docker (recommended)**
```bash
docker build -t clinical-dicom-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env clinical-dicom-api
```

**3b. Run locally**
```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**4. Open the interactive API docs**

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Example Response

`POST /dicom/summarize` with a cardiac CT file returns:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "modality": "CT",
    "body_part": "HEART",
    "slice_thickness": "0.625",
    "cardiac_trigger": "ECG",
    "trigger_delay": "275.0",
    "heart_rate": "62"
  },
  "summary": "ECG-triggered cardiac CT acquired at a trigger delay of 275ms, corresponding to mid-diastole. Slice thickness of 0.625mm provides high spatial resolution suitable for ventricular flow analysis and device positioning assessment."
}
```
